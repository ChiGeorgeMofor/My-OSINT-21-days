DAY-10: SCRAPING
  
Scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.
In python this is mostly done using libaries like BeautifulSoup, requests, Scrapy, Selenium..

The most important thing to know about scraping and python is that writing your own scripts from scratch for each task is most often not the best solution. 
It is better to try different ready made tools first.
