DAY-12: Proxies

Many sites and services block IP addresses that send  a large number of requests in a short time. 
A proxy server, also known as an appication-level gateway, can be a piece of software or a computer. It functions as a gateway betweeen your device and the server you are connected to. It's like an ambassador that acts as your representative when transacting with different servers on the web. 

Using them in Python, you just need to specify the address of the server you want to redirect traffic through when making a request.
